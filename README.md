# Employee-Retention

## Ideas
1. An app that that helps companies increase employee retention by highlighting internal employees that meet the criteria of a role left vacant by a senior employee

2. An app that helps women leaving for maternity to find external employees who will fill in their role for the year. These roles are filled in altruistically and meant to be filled part time for the length of the leave
